ATD stands for Adaptable Type Definitions. It is a syntax for defining
cross-language data types and it is used by
[atdgen](https://github.com/mjambon/atdgen) for defining the
type of [JSON](http://json.org) data and generating efficient
serializers, deserializers and validators.

The ATD language and its OCaml library were designed and implemented
at MyLife by Martin Jambon. We distribute the source code under the
terms of a BSD license.
